# FTCHr - Because Your Pets Need a Social Life Too

## Description

![badgeImg](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

FTCHr allows pet owners to meet up with others near them to set up play dates for their pets. Users are able to create an account and log into the application. Upon login, users are greeted with an interactive map of post locations in their area. These post locations are created by users who are looking to find other people and pets to meet. The logged in user can create their own posts and their current estimated location will render on the map if location permission is granted. Users are also able to select any of the users in the application and create a live conversation with the direct messaging feature as well.
