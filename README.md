This project allows pet owners to meet up with other pet owners near them and set up play dates for their pets. Users are able to log into the application and are greeted with a interactive map of post locations. These post locations are created by users who are looking to find other people to meet. The logged in user can create their own post and their current estimated location will render on the map. Users are also able to selected any of the users in the application and create a conversation with the direct messaging feature as well.
